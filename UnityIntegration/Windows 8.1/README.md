# Windows 8.1 Unity Build Sample

This is a Windows 8.1 sample built from Unity Project.

This sample demonstrates AdDuplex banner integration. AdDuplex package for Windows 8.1 is referenced via NuGet. Since no interstitial ads are available for Windows 8.1 this sample contains only a banner, and unity made buttons for Interstitial control are ignored.
