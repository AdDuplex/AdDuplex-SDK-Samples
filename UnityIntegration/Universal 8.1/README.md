# Windows Universal 8.1 Unity Build Sample

This is a Windows Universal 8.1 sample built from Unity Project.

This sample demonstrates AdDuplex banner integration. AdDuplex packages for Windows 8.1 and Windows Phone 8.1 are referenced via NuGet. Since no interstitial ads are available for Windows 8.1, sample contains only a banner, and unity made buttons for Interstitial control are ignored.
